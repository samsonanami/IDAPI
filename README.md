## Story behind our nickname

We believe each and every solution that we build is with heart to **inspire emotions** in many lives in the world. 
We need a meaningful name because we want to associate that mark with something that bear resemblance to its true prupose.
After all, a name is the first emotional attachment to everything around us.

Hence we turned to Greek Methology and gave our project the name **Orion**.Greek meaning of this term is *rising in the sky* . 
There are moments that we look upto the sky and wonder till something make sense. Our solution just do excatly that. 
In this case, make sense about validity of identification documents ;-). 
Not only the product but all the other sub modules has its own names. Dive into the project to know more.
